Technical assessment - Rocket.Chat Enterprise Solutions team - Technical Support Analyst position

**IMPORTANT NOTE on each Document**

Rocket.Chat Install Server Documentation Part1:
The tool I used is “Ngrok” that exposes the localhost through a secure connection. Please do take note that ngrok used in this technical challenge is a free trial and is limited to 8hrs. That may require the reviewee to notify me to run ngrok or provide the time to access the environment within the limitation of the free trial.

Rocket.Chat APIs Test Part 2:
Get a list of all user roles in the system via an API endpoint.
o	*Please take note that I provided two request/response, because it stated that “get a list of all user roles”. I’m not sure if it meant to get the user roles list or a list of all user and their roles.*

I also provided json file on each operation.

Please let me know the result of my application.
Have a nice day!
